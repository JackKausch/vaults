Soon I shall begin reading The Mirror of Simple Souls by [[Marguerite Porete]]. I will put my notes here. (December 2021)

I am reading now in [[Mystical Languages of Unsaying]] by Michael A. Sells. He has three chapters on Porete, [[Meister Eckhart]] and the relations between them. This book contains a summary of the Mirror of Simple Souls.

The book is a dialogue based on Medieval literature of [[Courtly Love]] applied to mysticism. It deals with the nature of [[Reason]] to [[Amor]], and to the mysterious [[FarNear]], who represents [[The Holy Trinity]]. I have not yet read the primary source. (09/01/2022)
